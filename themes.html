					<li data-theme="b">Art's Purpose</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In a preface added to the story a year after it is first published, Wilde proposed that art has no purpose other than to be aesthetically pleasing, which varied greatly from the Victorian belief that art was meant be not only morally enlightening but also educational at the social level</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However Wilde's argument that art is merely aesthetically pleasing is quite contradictory to his writing</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Wilde provides a few examples of art being meaningful beyond its aesthetic view during the story</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The first example is Basil's painting, the painting helps show the protagonist the physical dissipation that he has luckily avoided</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The message the painting reveals is far more than just an aesthetic beauty
					<li data-theme="c">The second piece of art that is significant in the novel is the yellow book that Dorian receives from Lord Henry</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The book acts as a guide to Dorian's life and helps lead him down the road to infamy and public scrutiny</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When looking at the story as a whole the reader can see that the author is arguing that it is dangerous to view art for something more than it really is as art can lead us down an unintended path</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Power in Youth and Beauty</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the story it is quite evident how much emphasis is put on beauty and youthfulness
					<li data-theme="c">The characters seemed to be absorbed in trying to seek out these attributes in themselves and the objects and people they surround themselves with, even to the extent that their own demise is accelerated by the seeking out of beauty</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lord Henry is a prime example of one who puts to much emphasis on these attributes, as in his discussions with Dorian he explains that Dorian will eventually lose these attributes, and explains that they are the most essential attributes one can have</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end Dorian pays the price for seeking out these attributes and putting them first by giving his life</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Society's Superficial Desires</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is quite evident throughout the novel that a mans morals or deeds are far less important to the characters featured than whether a man is handsome</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Dorian, though lacking some key ethical attributes, seems to have no trouble making himself quite popular in the upper class social scene of London</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The emphasis that society puts on looks and appearance proves just how out of touch the elite are during this time period with the most important attributes that make one human</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Problems Posed by Falling to Someone Else's Influence</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Two characters depicted in the novel seem to suffer greatly due to the influence they receive from others</li>
					<li data-theme="c">One is Basil, who is strongly influenced by Dorian and makes many life decisions based on said influence</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Basil is murdered in the novel and it is quite clear that the influence he receives from Dorian seemed to do him in
					<li data-theme="c">On the other hand Dorian falls under the influence of Lord Henry</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Dorian acts throughout the novel in a rather immoral way, with much of his actions attributed to the influence Lord Henry has over him</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end Dorian's desire to seek the superficial desires of life leads to his demise, and it can be seen in a way as a result of the influence of Lord Henry</li>
