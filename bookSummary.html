					<li data-theme="d">The novel tells of a young and very handsome young man by the name of Dorian Gray. Dorian becomes the subject of a skilled artist, Basil Hallward. Basil is enthralled by Dorian and paints a portrait of him so he can depict his handsomeness. Through Dorian's relationship with Basil, Dorian is introduced to a man that goes by Lord Henry. Lord Henry fascinates Dorian and teaches him that the most important things in life are beauty and fulfilling the senses. Dorian admires this view and realizes that even though he may seek beauty, eventually it will fade with age. Dorian makes a deal to sell his sole so that he will not age and will stay young forever, however the painting of him will take on his aging. Dorian is surprisingly granted this deal, yet with it comes the consequence of the loss of morals. Each of his sins and transgressions are depicted on the painting, and the painting comes to represent the terrible person Dorian is despite his outward beauty.</li>
